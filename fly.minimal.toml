# fly.minimal.toml - ArcadeDB Minimal Variant
# Optimized for fast cold starts with core features only
# Excludes: Gremlin, Redis, MongoDB, GraphQL protocols
# Includes: HTTP API, PostgreSQL wire protocol, gRPC, Binary replication

# PREREQUISITES:
# 1. Run Maven build first: mvn clean install -Pdocker
# 2. This creates: package/target/arcadedb-<version>-minimal.dir/
# 3. Deploy with: fly deploy -c fly.minimal.toml
